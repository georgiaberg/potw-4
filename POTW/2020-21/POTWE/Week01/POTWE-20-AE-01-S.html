<p align="center"><strong>Problem of the Week</strong></p>
<p align="center">Problem E and Solution</p>
<p align="center">Worth Checking <br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Students in three different classes wrote the same Calculus exam. The exam was marked out of 100.<br />
One class had 22 students in it. After writing the exam, their class average on the exam was reported as <span class="math inline">\(87\%\)</span>. The second class had 27 students in it. After writing the exam, their class average on the exam was reported as <span class="math inline">\(83\%\)</span>. The third class had 31 students in it. After writing the exam, their class average on the exam was reported as <span class="math inline">\(81\%\)</span>.<br />
Three students, Alf, Bet, and Tildi, discussed their results. Alf obtained a mark one less than Bet and Tildi obtained a mark one more than Bet.<br />
Upon reviewing their papers, Alf and Bet both discovered addition errors on their papers. Both of their marks increased to <span class="math inline">\(92\)</span>. Tildi discovered that one of her questions had not been marked. This review resulted in her mark increasing to <span class="math inline">\(92\)</span> as well.<br />
These changes resulted in the exam average for all of the students in the three classes combined changing to exactly <span class="math inline">\(84\%\)</span>.<br />
What marks did Alf, Bet and Tildi originally have on their papers before the errors were corrected?<br />
</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" style="height:6cm" src="images/twostudents.png" /> <img alt="" style="height:6cm" src="images/onestudent.png" /><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong><u>Solution 1</u></strong><br />
Let Bet’s original mark be <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Then Alf’s original mark is <span class="math inline">\(b-1\)</span> and Tildi’s original mark is <span class="math inline">\(b+1\)</span>.<br />
The total number of marks for a class can be calculated by multiplying the number of students by the class average.<br />
The total number of marks in the first class before the error was discovered was <span class="math inline">\(22\times 87=1914\)</span>. The total number of marks in the second class before the error was discovered was <span class="math inline">\(27\times 83=2241\)</span>. The total number of marks in the third class before the error was discovered was <span class="math inline">\(31\times 81=2511\)</span>.<br />
The total of the marks from the three classes before correcting the errors was <span class="math inline">\(1914+2241+2511=6666\)</span>. To correct the errors, we subtract the three incorrect marks from the total and add the three correct marks. The new total is therefore <span class="math display">\[6666-(b-1)-b-(b+1)+3\times 92=6666-3b+276=6942-3b\hspace{10mm}(1)\]</p>
<p>The total number of students in the three classes combined was <span class="math inline">\(22+27+31=80\)</span>. Since the average after correcting the three errors was exactly <span class="math inline">\(84\%\)</span>, the total number of marks for the three classes was <span class="math inline">\(80\times 84=6720\hspace{4mm}(2)\)</span>.<br />
But (1) and (2) represent the same total. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(6942-3b=6720\)</span>. It follows that <span class="math inline">\(3b=222\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b=74\)</span>.<br />
Since <span class="math inline">\(b=74\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b-1=73\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b+1=75\)</span>.<br />
Therefore, Alf’s original mark was <span class="math inline">\(73\)</span>, Bet’s original mark was <span class="math inline">\(74\)</span> and Tildi’s original mark was <span class="math inline">\(75\)</span>.<br />
<strong><u>Solution 2</u></strong><br />
</p>
<p>Let Bet’s original mark be <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Then Alf’s original mark is <span class="math inline">\(b-1\)</span> and Tildi’s original mark is <span class="math inline">\(b+1\)</span>.<br />
The total number of marks for a class can be calculated by multiplying the number of students by the class average.<br />
The total number of marks in the first class before the error was discovered was <span class="math inline">\(22\times 87=1914\)</span>. The total number of marks in the second class before the error was discovered was <span class="math inline">\(27\times 83=2241\)</span>. The total number of marks in the third class before the error was discovered was <span class="math inline">\(31\times 81=2511\)</span>.<br />
The total of the marks from the three classes before correcting the errors was <span class="math inline">\(1914+2241+2511=6666\)</span>.<br />
The total number of students in the three classes combined was <span class="math inline">\(22+27+31=80\)</span>. Since the average after correcting the three errors was exactly <span class="math inline">\(84\%\)</span>, the total number of marks for the three classes was <span class="math inline">\(80\times 84=6720\)</span>.<br />
The total mark change is then <span class="math inline">\(6720-6666=54\)</span>.<br />
But the total mark change can also be calculated by subtracting each of their old marks from 92 and then adding the three differences.<br />
Therefore <span class="math inline">\([92-(b-1)]+[92-b]+[92-(b+1)]=54\)</span>. Then,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
92-b+1+92-b+92-b-1&amp;=54\\
276-3b&amp;=54\\
222&amp;=3b\\
74&amp;=b\\\end{aligned}\]</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(b=74\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b-1=73\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b+1=75\)</span>.<br />
Therefore, Alf’s original mark was <span class="math inline">\(73\)</span>, Bet’s original mark was <span class="math inline">\(74\)</span> and Tildi’s original mark was <span class="math inline">\(75\)</span>.<br />
