<h1>Problem of the Week<br />
Problem B and Solution<br />
Shape Up</h1>
</header>
<main role="solution">
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Determine the area of each of the four shapes below. In order to find the area, you may divide each shape up into other shapes in any way you need to.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Note:</span> All linear measures are in cm. Shape 1 has a vertical line of symmetry, Shape 2 has a horizontal line of symmetry, and Shape 3 has both a horizontal and a vertical line of symmetry. All angles in Shape 3 are right angles.</p>
<p><img src="images/ShapeB1.png" style="width:40.0%" alt="Shape 1 is a four sided polygon. It has two horizontal sides with top side of length 5 and bottom side of length 7. The distance between the top and bottom sides is 4 units." /> <img src="images/ShapeB2.png" style="width:40.0%" alt="Shape 2 is a composite shape made up of a square of side length 4 and a triangle. The base of the triangle runs vertically and is placed along one side of the square making a shape that looks like an arrow pointing right. The base of the triangle extends beyond the square by 2 units above and 2 units below. The height of the triangle, which runs horizontally, is 4 units." /></p>
<p><img src="images/ShapeB3.png" style="width:40.0%" alt="Shape 3 is a composite shape made up of three side by side rectangles: The middle rectangle has horizontal sides of length 8 and vertical sides of length 4. The left and right rectangles are identical. The top side of the left rectangle has length 1 and is 1 unit below the top side of the middle rectangle." /> <img src="images/ShapeB4.png" style="width:40.0%" alt="Shape 4 is a four sided polygon with two vertical sides of length 4 and 5 and one horizontal side of length 8." /></p>
<p><span><strong>Solution</strong></span> <span><br />
</span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>Shape 1:</strong></p>
<p>Solution 1: Divide the shape into two right-angled triangles and a rectangle, as shown.</p>
<p><img src="images/shapessoln1.png" style="width:40.0%" alt="A vertical line is drawn from each vertex of the top side of length 5 to the bottom side of length 7. These lines meet the bottom side at right angles and divide the bottom side into pieces of length 1, 5, and 1." /></p>
<p>Since there a vertical line of symmetry, the base of each triangle is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{7-5}{2}=1.\)</span> So each triangle has area <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1\times 4}{2} = 2\)</span>.<br />
The rectangle has dimensions 5 by 4, and so its area is <span class="math inline">\(5\times 4 = 20\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the area of Shape 1 is <span class="math inline">\(2 + 2 + 20 = 24\mbox{ cm}^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Solution 2: Divide the shape into two triangles, as shown.</p>
<p><img src="images/shapessoln1a.png" style="width:40.0%" alt="A diagonal line is drawn from top right vertex to the bottom left vertex. The heights of the two triangles formed are equal to height of Shape 1 which is 4." /></p>
<p>The bottom triangle has a base of 7 and a height of 4, so the area of this triangle is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{7\times 4}{2} = 14\)</span>.<br />
The top triangle has a base of 5 and a height of 4. (You may have to turn the page upside down to see this.) So the area of this triangle is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{5\times 4}{2} = 10\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the area of Shape 1 is <span class="math inline">\(14 + 10 = 24\mbox{ cm}^2\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Shape 2:</strong></p>
<p>Divide the shape into a square and a triangle, as shown.</p>
<p><img src="images/shapessoln2.png" style="width:40.0%" alt="Shape 2 is a composite shape that looks like an arrow pointing right. A vertical line of length 4 divides the arrow into two pieces." /></p>
<p>The square has a side length of 4, so the area of the square is <span class="math inline">\(4\times 4 = 16\)</span>.<br />
The triangle has base <span class="math inline">\(2+4+2=8\)</span> and height 4, so the area of the triangle is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{8\times 4}{2} = 16\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the area of Shape 2 is <span class="math inline">\(16 + 16 = 32\mbox{ cm}^2\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Shape 3:</strong></p>
<p>Solution 1: Divide the shape into three rectangles, vertically, as shown to the right.</p>
<p><img src="images/shapessoln3.png" style="width:40.0%" alt="Shape 3 is a composite shape made up of three side by side rectangles. Two vertical lines divide the shape into three pieces: a middle rectangle and two identical side rectangles." /></p>
<p>Each side rectangle has length <span class="math inline">\(4 -1 -1 =2\)</span> and width 1, so the area of each side rectangle is <span class="math inline">\(2\times 1 = 2\)</span>.<br />
The middle rectangle has the dimensions of 8 by 4, so its area is <span class="math inline">\(8\times 4 = 32\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the area of Shape 3 is <span class="math inline">\(2 + 2 + 32 = 36\mbox{ cm}^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Solution 2: Divide the shape into three rectangles, horizontally, as shown.</p>
<p><img src="images/shapessoln3a.png" style="width:40.0%" alt="Two horizontal lines divide the shape into three pieces: two identical top and bottom rectangles with vertical sides of length 1, and a middle rectangle that extends past the other rectangles by 1 unit on the left and 1 unit the right." /></p>
<p>The top and bottom rectangles have the dimensions of 1 by 8, so the area of each is <span class="math inline">\(1\times 8 = 8\)</span>.<br />
The length of the middle rectangle is <span class="math inline">\(8+ 1 + 1 = 10\)</span> and its width is <span class="math inline">\(4 - 1- 1 = 2\)</span>, so the middle rectangle has area <span class="math inline">\(10\times 2 = 20\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the area of Shape 3 is <span class="math inline">\(8 + 8 + 20= 36\mbox{ cm}^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Solution 3: Divide the shape into one rectangle with four 1 by 1 corners removed, as shown.</p>
<p><img src="images/shapessoln3b.png" style="width:40.0%" alt="Shape 3 is a large rectangle with a 1 by 1 square removed from each corner." /></p>
<p>The large rectangle has a length <span class="math inline">\(8 + 1  + 1 = 10\)</span> and width is 4, so its area is <span class="math inline">\(10\times 4 = 40\)</span>. Each of the corner squares has dimensions of 1 by 1, so area <span class="math inline">\(1\times 1 = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the area of Shape 3 is <span class="math inline">\(40 - 4 \times 1 = 36\mbox{ cm}^2\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Shape 4:</strong></p>
<p>Solution 1: Divide the shape into a rectangle and a triangle, as shown.</p>
<p><img src="images/shapessoln4.png" style="width:40.0%" alt="A horizontal line is drawn through Shape 4 from the top of the side of length 4 over to the side of length 5. This line divides the shape into a rectangle of height 4 and a right-angled triangle of height 1. The base of the triangle lies along the top side of the rectangle." /></p>
<p>The base of the triangle is 8 and the height is <span class="math inline">\(5 - 4 = 1\)</span>, so the area of the triangle is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{8\times 1}{2} = 4\)</span>. The rectangle has the dimensions 4 by 8, so area <span class="math inline">\(4\times 8 = 32\)</span>.<br />
Therefore, the area of Shape 4 is <span class="math inline">\(4 + 32 = 36\mbox{ cm}^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Solution 2: Divide the shape into two triangles, as shown.</p>
<p><img src="images/shapessoln4a.png" style="width:40.0%" alt="A diagonal line is drawn from the top left vertex to the bottom right vertex of Shape 4. This divides the shape into a lower triangle with base lying along the bottom edge of the shape and an upper triangle with base running vertically along the right edge of the shape." /></p>
<p>The lower triangle has a base of 8 and a height of 4, so the area of the triangle is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{8\times 4}{2} = 16\)</span>. The upper triangle has a base of 5 and a height of 8, so the area of the triangle is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{5\times 8}{2} = 20\)</span>. Therefore, the area of Shape 4 is <span class="math inline">\(16 + 20 = 36\mbox{ cm}^2\)</span>.</p>
