<p align="center"><strong>Problem of the Week</strong></p>
<p align="center">Problem D and Solution</p>
<p align="center">Near Perfect <br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
</p>
<p>In ten-pin bowling, the highest possible score in a single game is 300.<br />
At one point in the bowling season, Fred F Stone had an average score of 177. In his next game he obtained a score of 199, which caused his average to increase to 178. After one more game Fred would like his average to be 183.<br />
Is it possible for Fred to accomplish this? If it is possible, what score does he need in his next game? If it is not possible, explain why not.<br />
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/bowling.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong><u>Solution 1</u></strong><br />
Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be the number of games bowled to achieve his 177 average. His total points scored in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> games is his average times <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Therefore, Fred has <span class="math inline">\(177n\)</span> total points in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> games.<br />
To compute his average after bowling the 199 game, we take his new total points and divide by <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>, the new number of games.<br />
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\mbox{Average}&amp;=\frac{\mbox{Total Points}}{\mbox{Games Played}}\\
178&amp;=\frac{177n+199}{n+1}\\
178(n+1)&amp;=177n+199\\
178n+178&amp;=177n+199\\
n&amp;=21\\[-8mm]\end{aligned}\] Prior to bowling the 199 game, Fred had bowled 21 games. So after bowling the 199 game, Fred has bowled 22 games. Fred wants to have a 183 average after bowling his 23rd game. The difference between his total points after 23 games with a 183 average and his total points after bowling 22 games with a 178 average must be his score on the 23rd game.<br />
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\mbox{Score on 23rd Game}&amp;=23\times 183-22\times 178=4209-3916=293\\[-6mm]\end{aligned}\] Therefore it is possible for Fred to raise his average from 178 to 183 in a single game, but he must bowl 293 in his next game to do this. This is a near perfect game.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Solution 2</u></strong><br />
Fred’s score of 199 is <span class="math inline">\(199-177=22\)</span> points above his previous average. The game where Fred scored 199 raised his average 1 point. Therefore, his game with the 199 score must have been his 22nd game.<br />
To raise his average 5 points in his 23rd game he must bowl <span class="math inline">\(5\times 23=115\)</span> points above his 178 average. Therefore, he must bowl <span class="math inline">\(178+115=293\)</span> in his next game.<br />
Therefore, it is possible for Fred to raise his average from 178 to 183 in a single game, but he must bowl 293 in his next game to do this. This is a near perfect game.<br />
We can verify our results:<br />
      Average on 21 games is 177.<br />
      Average on 22 games <span class="math inline">\(=\dfrac{21\times 177+199}{22}=\dfrac{3916}{22}=178\)</span><br />
      Average on 23 games <span class="math inline">\(=\dfrac{22\times 178+293}{23}=\dfrac{4209}{23}=183\)</span></p>
