<h1>Problem of the Week<br />

Fund Raising</h1>

<main role="solution">
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/oldlaptop.png" style="height:3cm" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Room 9 is raising funds for a tree-planting charity by recycling electronics. They have found a local company that will give them <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span> for each pound of computer e-waste and <span class="math inline">\(\$2\)</span> for each pound of cell phone e-waste.</p>
<p>The school only has metric measuring tools. Here is what they have gathered to recycle:</p>
<p><strong>Computers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> Bonobo laptops: <span class="math inline">\(800\)</span> g each</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> uPads: <span class="math inline">\(600\)</span> g each</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> HomeBooks: <span class="math inline">\(1.2\)</span> kg each</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cell Phones</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> uPhones: <span class="math inline">\(375\)</span> g each</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> Mixel phones: <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> g each</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing that <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> pound is approximately <span class="math inline">\(454\)</span> g, find an estimation of how much money Room <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> will make. Justify your answer.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Solutions may vary, possibly resulting in different final approximations. We are going to show three possible solutions. In each solution we will use the following information:<br />
Since <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> pound is approximately <span class="math inline">\(454\)</span> g and <span class="math inline">\(500\)</span> g is <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> kg, then <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> pound is approximately <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> kg. So,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> kg is approximately <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> pound, and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> kg is approximately <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> pounds.</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Solution 1:</span></strong></span> We will look at first approximating the mass of each item.<br />
Knowing this, we can estimate the total mass of the e-waste that was gathered, and then calculate how much it is worth.</p>
<p><em>Computers:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bonobo laptops: Since each laptop is approximately <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> kg, six Bonobo laptops are approximately <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> kg.</p></li>
<li><p>uPads: Since each uPad is approximately <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> kg, four uPads are approximately <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> kg.</p></li>
<li><p>HomeBooks: Since each HomeBook is approximately <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> kg, two HomeBooks are approximately <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> kg.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is approximately <span class="math inline">\(6 + 2 + 2 = 10\)</span> kg of computer waste.<br />
Since each <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> kg is approximately <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> pounds, then there is approximately <span class="math inline">\(10 \times 2 = 20\)</span> pounds of computer waste.</p>
<p>The computer e-waste is worth approximately $<span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Phones:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>uPhones: Since each uPhone is approximately <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> kg, two uPhones are approximately <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> kg.</p></li>
<li><p>Mixel phones: Since each Mixel phone is <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> g, then four Mixel phones are <span class="math inline">\(400\)</span> g, or approximately <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> kg.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is approximately <span class="math inline">\(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\)</span> kg of cell phone waste.<br />
Since each <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> kg is approximately <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> pounds, then there is approximately <span class="math inline">\(1.5 \times 2 = 3\)</span> pounds of cell phone waste.</p>
<p>The cell phone e-waste is worth approximately <span class="math inline">\(\$6\)</span>.</p>
<p>So the total value is approximately <span class="math inline">\(\$20 + \$6 = \$26\)</span>.<br />
<span><strong><span>Solution 2:</span></strong></span> Since there are a small number of items for each waste product, we will find the mass for each specific waste product in kg and then approximate the mass in pounds.<br />
<em>Computers:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bonobo laptops: Since each laptop is <span class="math inline">\(800\)</span> g, then six laptops are <span class="math inline">\(6 \times 800= 4800\)</span> g. Therefore, six Bonobo laptops are approximately <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> kg.</p></li>
<li><p>uPads: Since each uPad is <span class="math inline">\(600\)</span> g, then four uPads are <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 600 =  2400\)</span> g. Therefore, four uPads are approximately <span class="math inline">\(2.5\)</span> kg.</p></li>
<li><p>HomeBooks: Since each HomeBook is <span class="math inline">\(1.2\)</span> kg, then two are <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 1.2 = 2.4\)</span> kg. Therefore, two HomeBooks are approximately <span class="math inline">\(2.5\)</span> kg.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is approximately <span class="math inline">\(5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 10\)</span> kg of computer waste.<br />
Since each <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> kg is approximately <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> pounds, then there is approximately <span class="math inline">\(10 \times 2 = 20\)</span> pounds of computer waste.</p>
<p>The computer e-waste is worth approximately <span class="math inline">\(\$20\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Phones:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>uPhones: Since each uPhone is <span class="math inline">\(375\)</span> g, then two uPhones are <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 375 = 750\)</span> g. Therefore, two uPhones are approximately <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> kg.</p></li>
<li><p>Mixel phones: Since each Mixel phone is <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> g, then four Mixel phones are <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 100 = 400\)</span> g. Therefore, four Mixel phones are approximately <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> kg.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is approximately <span class="math inline">\(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\)</span> kg of cell phone waste.<br />
Since each <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> kg is approximately <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> pounds, then there is approximately <span class="math inline">\(1.5 \times 2 = 3\)</span> pounds of cell phone waste.</p>
<p>The cell phone e-waste is worth approximately <span class="math inline">\(\$6\)</span>.</p>
<p>So the total value is approximately <span class="math inline">\(\$20 + \$6 = \$26\)</span>.<br />
<span><strong><span>Solution 3:</span></strong></span> In this third solution, we will find the total mass of computer waste in kg and the total mass of cell phone waste in kg, and then approximate these totals in pounds.<br />
<em>Computers:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bonobo laptops: Since each laptop is <span class="math inline">\(800\)</span> g, then six laptops are <span class="math inline">\(6 \times 800= 4800\)</span> g.</p></li>
<li><p>uPads: Since each uPad is <span class="math inline">\(600\)</span> g, then four uPads are <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 600 =  2400\)</span> g.</p></li>
<li><p>HomeBooks: Since each HomeBook is <span class="math inline">\(1.2\)</span> kg, then two are <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 1.2 = 2.4\)</span> kg, which is equal to <span class="math inline">\(2400\)</span> g.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, there is <span class="math inline">\(4800 + 2400 + 2400 = 9600\)</span> g, which is equal to <span class="math inline">\(9.6\)</span> kg. Therefore, there is approximately <span class="math inline">\(9.5\)</span> kg of computer waste.<br />
Since each <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> kg is approximately 1 pound, then there is approximately <span class="math inline">\(9 \times 2 + 1= 19\)</span> pounds of computer waste.</p>
<p>The computer e-waste is worth approximately <span class="math inline">\(\$19\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Phones:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>uPhones: Since each uPhone is 375 g, then two uPhones are <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 375 = 750\)</span> g.</p></li>
<li><p>Mixel phones: Since each Mixel phone is 100 g, then four Mixel phones are <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 100 = 400\)</span> g.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, there is <span class="math inline">\(750 + 400 = 1150\)</span> g, which is approximately <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> kg. Since each <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> kg is approximately <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> pounds, then there is approximately <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> pounds of cell phone waste.</p>
<p>The cell phone e-waste is worth approximately <span class="math inline">\(\$4\)</span>.</p>
<p>So the total value is approximately <span class="math inline">\(\$19 + \$4 = \$23\)</span>.</p>
<h3>Teacher’s Notes</h3>
<p>Did you know that a kilogram is not what it used to be?</p>
<p>Like many units of measurement, the definition of a kilogram was linked to a physical model. In 1795, French law defined a kilogram as the mass of 1000 cubic centimetres (or 1 litre) of water. In 1799, a physical prototype was commissioned and stored at the Archives Nationales in Paris. At the time, this platinum cylinder was the standard for a kilogram.</p>
<p>Over time, the physical model would not necessarily be exactly the same as when it was commissioned. In 1879, the definition of a kilogram was updated to be the mass of <span class="math inline">\(1~\text{dm}^3\)</span> of water under atmospheric pressure and maximum water density, which is measured at approximately 4 degrees Celsius. At that time a new platinum-iridium prototype was commissioned and stored at the Archives Nationales.</p>
<p>In May 2019, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures announced the new official definition of a kilogram. It changed from a physical model to a mathematical definition based on universal constants: <em>Planck’s constant</em>, the speed of light, and the radiation generated by a cesium atom. This relatively recent update makes the kilogram the last unit of measurement in the International System of Units (SI) to be linked to a physical artifact.</p>
